## Installation
Copy a rom of `Sonic 3 & Knuckles` to ports/sonic3air and rename it to `Sonic_Knuckles_wSonic3.bin`.

## Default Controls
Sonic 3 AIR runs entirely on SDL controls and plays like any other Sonic game.

## Mods
Mod folders can be pasted into `sonic3air/config/mods` and then toggled on or off at the title screen. This port comes with a sample mod called `classic-mode` which comes from the [Sonic3AIR GitHub repository](https://github.com/Eukaryot/sonic3air/tree/main/Oxygen/sonic3air/_master_image_template/doc/sample-mods/classic-mode-sample-mod) and was modified to add a 3:2 aspect ratio option.
