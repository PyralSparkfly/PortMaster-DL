# Note: The actual armhf SDL library used in the port was built
# by BinaryCounter, but the following should be equivalent. The
# important things are:
# * armhf (i386 could also work, might be slower)
# * -fPIC
# * version 2.0.16 (other versions may be incompatible)
# * don't link to libibus (uses libraries that aren't available on AmberELEC)

git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git
cd SDL

git checkout release-2.0.16

# Don't link to libibus
