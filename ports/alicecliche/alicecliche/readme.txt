Alice in Clicheland is a game developed for Digital Games Development course, taken during our Computer Science grad school at UFMG. It is an action RPG game, where the action takes place in real time. With its 2D graphics and aerial view, Alice in Clicheland recalls SNES RPG games, like Final Fantasy and Zelda.

The game was made using C++ and Allegro 4 library.

## How to play

#### Player 1:
 - arrows: walk
 - A: attack
 - S: magic
 - Z: talk/examine
 - hold X: use stamina (runs, attacks faster)
 - 1, 2, 3, 4: select magic
 - Esc: quit the game
 - Tab: Change between multiplayer/single player

#### Player 2:
 - I, J, K, L: walk
 - D: attack
 - F: magic
 - C: talk/examine
 - hold V: use stamina (runs, attacks faster)
 - 5, 6, 7, 8: select magic

The keys used by player 2 are not very good, but that's because we made the game in a notebook without numeric keyboard. You can use a joystick with Xpadder to make things easier.

## Plot

Alice in Clicheland is a game set on a fantasy world, where two dimensions coexist. Those dimensions were separated by a great hero during Primordial War. For some reason, though, the seal that used to keep the dimensions apart was broken, chaining a new war, as Dark Clicheland's beings tried to invade the human world: Clicheland.

Alice is a young girl that joined the human army with her brother, Bob, seeking fame and money, that were promised by the governors during the crisis. After two long years of battle, her brother was brutally killed by the enemy forces, on Berun Battle. Her army went through many losses, being forced to flee from the battlefield. Suffering the loss of her brother, Alice gave up the soldier's carrier and went back to her quiet life as a seller...
