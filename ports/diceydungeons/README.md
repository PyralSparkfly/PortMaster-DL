### Installation

Purchase the game on GoG, Steam or itch.io. Only the linux version is compatible. Steam files can be downloaded using the Steam console command `download_depot 861540 861543`. For GoG, place the installer `dicey_dungeons...sh` in `ports/diceydungeons/gamedata`. For Steam/itch (or pre-extracted GoG files), place the game files so that `diceydungeons`, `soundstuff` and surrounding files and folders are in `ports/diceydungeons/gamedata`.

### Rocknix libmali

This port is not compatible with Rocknix libmali. Please use the system menus to switch to Panfrost.

### Performance

The game takes 30s to start. After that, performance is good on h700 and higher.
### Controls

Press Start for options and mods menus. See in-game guidance for other controls.
### Graphics

Screen effects and shaders are disabled by default for performance reasons. You can re-enable them using the options menu.
### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Terry Cavanagh, Chipzel and [the Dicey Dungeons team](https://diceydungeons.com/credits.html) for the great game.

Thanks to ptitSeb for [box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64) and binarycounter for [Westonpack](https://github.com/binarycounter/Westonpack/wiki), without both of which this port would not be possible.

Thanks also to binarycounter for crucial help with the port.
